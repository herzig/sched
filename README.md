A Simulation environment to help in the analysis of different scheduling strategies. 
  - Spawn tasks with fixed or unlimited runtime
  - Tasks can be given a CPU utilisation value to simulate I/O bound tasks
  - 4-State Task model (RUNNING, READY, BLOCKED, DONE)
  - Easy interface to implement new Schedulers
  - Timeline visualisation of task states.
